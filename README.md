# SearchIn-BE

#### about the site
 A website that allows registered users to add websites with a search engine that use the GET protocol,
 And then search inside all ther websites  from one search bar.

### the development process
- I developed this site after graduation due to my own need, the FrontEnd of the site was developed in React, in addition I used the following libraries:
NEXT.JS and fortawesome.
FrontEnd runs on netlify.

- The backEnd of the site was written in Node.js and allows the self-adjustment of each user, in addition I used the following libraries:
bcryptjs ,dotenv , jsonwebtoken , mongodb And in addition I used serverless function netlify.

- As the Database I used MongoDB.
